    The briefing begins within an hour before the operation can begin. Once arrived at chose Objective Rally Point, your unit will move out at 0530 to the objective.</br>
    Once discovered, and enemy reports losses, we expect it will take about 90 minutes (at 0700), before enemy heavier reinforcements will arrive, and will threaten our further reinforcements. After that it will be a matter of hour, before your safe paths to retreat and evacuation will be completely cut off.
