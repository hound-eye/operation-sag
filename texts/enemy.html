<h2>Enemy overview</h2>
    Russian 1st MSV (Motor rifle troops) Battalion of the 58th MSV Brigade is the unit that is deployed in this area.<br/>

    The battalion consists primarily of mobilized conscripts, with some volunteer soldiers (mostly officers). And as the result of heavy losses sustained during its deployment, it is severely understaffed and underequipped, and maintains a poor discipline.<br/>

<h2>1st Battalion structure:</h2>
- 3 MSV companies, that are spread across the village and its surrounding area. They also man the outposts and conduct patrols on foot or light unarmored vehicles.<br/>
- Mortar battery - equipped with Podnos mortars.<br/>
- Anti-air platoon - team that employs IGLA MANPADS and one truck-mounted ZU-23 cannon for defense against aircraft and drones.<br/>
- Signal platoon - responsible for manning the R-142N vehicle, equipped for long range communications.<br/>
- Airreconnoisance platoon - a scout team, that uses TIGR armored vehicle and employs various drones.<br/>
- Support and maintenance platoon - supporting unit that provides maintenance for battalion's weapons, vehicle and other provisions.<br/>
<br/>
<h2>Outposts</h2>
    All troops are using standard issue small arms, such as AK-74, SVD, PKP. Body armor <br/>
    Our intel counted at least 3 fortified checkpoints at western, northern and eastern approaches to the Vasylivka. They a garrisoned by a well equipped troops with crew-served weapons, so it is advised to avoid them, if possible. However, there could be additional supplies (weapons, ammunitions, medical resources) stashed at these outposts.<br/>
<h2>Fighting vehicles and weapon systems</h2>
    A large amount of this battalion's force, including its fighting vehicles (BTRs and BMPs) is currently not present in this area, as it is involved in another ongoing operation at the frontline. However, we can expect neighbouring enemy units will send their own mechanized and motorized troops to the assistance of Vasylivka garrison.<br/>
