    The Russian MSV forces occupy this north-eastern area of Ukraine. The village of Vasylivka is far from the nearest frontline, where offensive operations are ongoing. While most of our and the enemy's forces are concentrated in that area, we are looking for opportunities to perform a surprise attack in the enemy rear lines, targeting units that are in reserve or on recovery.<br/>
<br/>
    Your team's mission is to conduct a raid around the village of Vasylivka in the morning, in order to reduce enemy fighting ability in this area.<br/>
    Locate and secure intel from enemy battalion headquarters, destroy key assets, and leave the area before heavy reinforcements arrive.<br/>
